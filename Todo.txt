1 - understand the explanability on GNN methods with specifying the cons and the task that serv
    [modifyed this task]
    1- for specfic task search for explanability methods
//2 - search for GNN's for classification/opject detection task
//3 - GNN for image classification/object detection:
    //1 - feature pyramid netwwork + GCN.
    //2 - FPN + (CNN for classification OR any method that serv this task) # cna't do it because you sh
2 - implement explanability methods and evaluat them:
    - using GraphXAI:
        - install GraphXAI try the implemented method of explanability in it 
        - read their paper to deeply see how they evaluat 
3 - search if there a method that enhance the a segmentation method by gnn in medical 
4 - explanability method for
